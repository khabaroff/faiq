Every time you explain your team's
coding standards to Claude, you're
repeating yourself.
Every PR review, you redescribe how you
want feedback [music] structured. Every
commit message, you remind Claude of
your preferred format,
and skills fix this. A skill is a
markdown file that teaches Claude
[music] how to do something once, and
Claude applies that knowledge
automatically whenever it's relevant.
Agent skills are folders of
instructions, scripts, and resources
that Asia can discover and use to do
things more accurately and efficiently.
With Claw Code, we have the skill MD
file. The description is how Claw
decides whether to use the skill. When
you ask Claude to review this PR, it
matches your request against available
skill descriptions and finds this one.
Claude reads your request, compares it
to all available skill descriptions, and
activates the ones that match.
You can store skills in a few places
depending on who needs them. Personal
skills go in the home
directory.cloud/skills
and follow you across all your project.
These are your preferences, your commit
message style, your documentation
format, how you like code explained.
Project skills go in the do.claw/skills
inside of the root directory of your
repository. Anyone who clones the
repository gets these skills
automatically. This is where team
standards live, like your company's
brand guidelines, preferred fonts, and
colors that you use for web design.
Cloud code has several ways to customize
behavior. Skills are unique because
they're automatic and task specific.
CloudMD files load into every
conversation. If you want claw to always
use typescript strict mode that goes in
your claw.md file. Skills on the other
hand load on demand when they match your
request. It only loads in the name and
description. So it doesn't fill up your
entire context window. Your PR review
checklist doesn't need to be in the
context when you're debugging. It loads
when you actually ask for a review.
Slash commands require you to type them.
Skills don't. Claude applies them when
it recognizes the situation.
Skills work best for specialized
knowledge that applies to specific
tasks, code review standards your team
follows, commit message formats that you
prefer, brand guidelines of your
organization.
If you find yourself explaining the same
thing [music] to Claude repeatedly,
well, that's a skill waiting to be
written.
